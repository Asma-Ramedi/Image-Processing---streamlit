# Image Processing using Streamlit and OpenCV

This Python script utilizes Streamlit, a web app framework, along with OpenCV library for image processing operations.

## Description

The script allows users to perform various image processing tasks on uploaded images. Here's an overview of the functionality:

1. **File Upload:** Users can upload an image in JPG or PNG format.
2. **Display Original Image:** The uploaded image is displayed as the original image.
3. **Conversion to Grayscale:** The script converts the original image to grayscale and displays it.
4. **Thresholding:** A binary threshold is applied to the grayscale image, generating a black and white image.
5. **Erosion:** The script performs erosion on the black and white image, displaying the eroded image.
6. **Dilation:** Dilation is applied to the eroded image, generating the dilated image.
7. **Blur Operation:** Finally, a blur operation is performed on the dilated image.

## Instructions

To use the script:

1. Run the code in a Python environment that supports Streamlit and OpenCV.
2. Upload an image in JPG or PNG format.
3. View the different processed versions of the uploaded image based on the available operations.

## Usage
